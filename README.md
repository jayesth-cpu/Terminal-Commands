# Terminal-Commands

# It contains basic commands on how to navigate between files and folders in Terminal.
If you’ve been using a Mac for any length of time, you know that it’s more than just a 
pretty point-and-click, window-and-icon interface. Terminal (in your /Applications/Utilities folder) 
is the default gateway to that command line on a Mac. With it, instead of pointing and clicking, you type 
your commands and your Mac does your bidding.
