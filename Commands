// When you’re in the Finder and you want to move to another folder, you find that folder and double-click it. From the command line, you use the cd (or change directory) command instead. So let’s say you’re in your Home folder and want to peek inside the Downloads folder. To do that, you’d type cd Downloads. (Remember to always type a space after any command that has an additional argument, such as the name of a directory in the previous example.) Once you’ve done that, ls will show you the contents of your Downloads folder.
If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)
If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk.
If you type cd .. (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder.
And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.

--> ls  
// it is used to list all the files in your particular directory.
--> ls -la 
// it is used to list all the hidden files in that directory.

--> make (file_name, without extension)
// creates a temp. file that you can run in the terminal.
--> ./(file name, without extension)
// this command runs your file in the terminal.
--> rm (file name)
// it is used to remove that temp. file created in your terminal.

// Everytime you make a change in the file you'll have to recompile (use --> make ,command) and then re-run the file to reflect 
chnages.
